Often you need to share data and insights with colleagues who are not familiar with Python programming and want to stick to spreadsheets like those of MS Excel. Being able to edit from your Jupyter notebook a spreadsheet shared through Google Drive will save you lots of time and effort. Such a solution will provide to the rest of the team an easy way to access the freshest data and stats without having to go through lines of code.
